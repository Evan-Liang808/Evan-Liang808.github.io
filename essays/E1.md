I was a little worried when I started my WODS but it wasn't too bad if you prepared before and did not procrastinate. I say this because I was unable to get WOD 3.3 to work because I ran out of time and decided to just submit what I had. But besides not finishing, I thought the hardest part was WOD 3.1, even with the preparation I still stuggled a little. Also, I kept forgetting to do commentary throughout the videos because I was focused on following my notes and seeing if the code was working. I also realized that I forgot to show me stopping the timer in the third video. This is the first ones so now I get a feel of how WODS work. The biggest struggle I had was when I was doing the css for WOD 3.2 and had it linked in the index.html but it wouldn't work so I had to keep stopping the video s the times don't match up throughout the video but I finally figured out that I forgot to change the number in my URL.
