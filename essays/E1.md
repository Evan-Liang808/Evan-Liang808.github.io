I had no idea how to start the WODS so I watched the videos first. I watched it and got started and started practicing, going through each step and seeing if I understood it and made little notes to follow throuhgout each step on a separate doc. I stopped the video and tried to follow each step on my own based on my knowledge of HTML and CSS. When I got stuck, I would check the videos or ask someone for help. It took me 1 hour to slowly go through each step and understand what I was doing so I could do WOD 3.1 in a efficient time. With the preparation and notes, I was able to complete WOD 3.1 fairly easy. WOD 3.2 gave me a lot of trouble only because I made the mistake and didn't change the directory in mh URL so I kepy going through BrowserHistory1 instead of BrowserHistory2. I spent a whole 30 minutes trying to figure out why my css wouldn't link so I stopped my timer and recording. I unfortunately procrastinated so I didn't have time to redo the video so I kept pausing and stopping the timer which is something I don't think we are supposed to do. after I finally figured out how to make my css work, I continued and completed the WOD3.2. Since I procrastinated, I was unable to complete 3.2 and make it work. I was able to finish the code and the css was all completed but I was unable to make it show up on my index.html. I am unsure what happened or if I made the same mistake and didn't change my URL but I ran out of time and decided to just turn in what I had. Throuhgout all my recordings, I kept forgetting to start and stop the timers so I had to restart the videos which was very frusturating and you can see that in WOD 3.3 I forget to show my final finished time because I forget to stop the timer. I will learn from this and do my WODS earlier so I can complete it correctly and within a good time. This was good practice and for the most part, I did understand what I was typing out in my Index and Css. You definitely cannot go into WODS blind, spending some time, no matter how long preparing can help you complete your videos a lot faster.
