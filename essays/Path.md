I have always struggled deciding what degree I wanted to pursue when I got to college. I spent the first one and a half years exploring the different majors and weighing the pros and cons of each. After explorng the different majors, I finally decided on business, I had another choice to make since business included so many areas of focus. I asked many people and did an abundance of research on all the areas on business. I eventually stumbled upon MIS and thought a business degree that relates to IT? I found it interesting and did a little more research about it and found that maybe this was the way to do because it taught you things relating to business and Technology, and with the direction the world is moving, IT would be a great career to have in the future.
