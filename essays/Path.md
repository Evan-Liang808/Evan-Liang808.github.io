I have always struggled with deciding what degree I wanted to pursue when I got to college. I spent the first one and a half years exploring the different majors and weighing the pros and cons of each. After exploring the different majors, I finally decided on business. I had another choice to make since business included so many areas of focus. I asked many people and did an abundance of research on all the areas of business. I eventually stumbled upon MIS and business degree that relates to IT? I found it interesting and did a little more research about it, and I found that maybe this was the way to go because it taught you things relating to business and technology, and with the direction the world is moving, IT would be a great career to have in the future.
